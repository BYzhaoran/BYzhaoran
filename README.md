## 🔬 About Me

I’m currently an undergraduate student majoring in **Electronic Information Science and Technology**.  
My passion lies at the intersection of **AI**, **embedded systems**, and **embodied intelligence**.  
I’m particularly interested in **visual learning**, **robotic perception**, and **real-time edge computing**.

My academic and personal projects revolve around intelligent systems that can see, think, and act in the physical world.
